Here's the problem statement-
Make it about machine learning – that seems to be a theme behind Google’s return to robotics, an effort that reportedly has more to do with software than creating mechanical creatures that resemble human beings. 
Nowadays companies are synthetically generating more and more datasets from the realistic simulation of the dynamics of robots. 
Your task is to predict the angular acceleration (target) of one of the robot arm's links. 
The training dataset contains features like angular positions, velocities and torques of the robot arm.

You can also find complete documentation of my solution in the repo.

Search for Model_Main.py file
That's the main file.
